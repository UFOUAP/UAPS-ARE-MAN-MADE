## How UAPs Actually Work
Please refer to the PDFs and other documents in this repository for the MATH and PHYSICS calculations that supports the UAP postulations. All apparent observations of UAP performance and flight capabilities can be explained simply using orbital mechanics, tensile strength of materials, and good old-fashioned ingenuity. We have been looking at this method for PILOTING UAPs from space for a few months and the following is the MOST REASONABLE and PROBABLE answer. The MATH and PHYSICS literature to support this postulation is INCLUDED in this repository.

## Who:
A foreign adversary with space capabilities, involving a significant number of recent space launches and payloads. This adversary is known for its high-tech manufacturing capabilities and a strong desire to use surveillance as a means to collect intelligence. They may also possess extensive experience in entertainment, including the use of invisible wires for various purposes (such as filiming martial artists who posses the magical skill of flight) achieved also through invisible wires.

## What:
Lightweight surveillance probes suspended by invisible woven fiber-optic cables. These high-strength data transmission cables are lowered or dropped from low Earth geosynchronous orbit satellites.

## Why:
Simple SPY EAVESDROPPING on opponent from stealth. The purpose is to monitor, spy, steal, and or collect MILITARY and industrial data silently without any noise and with minimal electronic exposure.

## How:
Sensor probes may come in various designs and configurations, including single tether and multi-tether setups that can be implemented with small maneuverable satellites. The probes are allowed to spool ahead of the satellite by many miles, and the invisible clear glass cables are kept taut, allowing the maneuvering of a probe to be a matter of simply using compressed air thrusters. Refer to the included documents for more details.

## HOW 2:
A large spool of custom braided transparent FIBER OPTIC cable is delivered to a SATELLITE or SPACE Station , it is then attached to small micro-satelites equiped with a high performance FISHING REEL and low cost compressed air THRUSTERS. If the SPY PROBE is detected the highly maneuverable SATELLITE may also have a small rocket propellant thruster that allows rapid evasion.

## HOW UAPs TRAVEL THOUSANDS OF KPH/MPH WITH NO APPARENT PROPULSION. 
UAPs have been observed to travel 2000MPH. How this is performed.
Its is not really that hard to do, in fact this is very siple newtonian mechanics, any object traveling at nearly 17,000 MPH simply needs to fire an inverse thruster in any available opposing direction to its current vector. From the observer (inside the atmosphere) or at the surface of the Earth will see the object move away from their observational position at high speed.
Simply put these UAPs are suspended from one or more clear glass WOVEN fiber optic  cables. There is no propulsion because the movement and control of the SENSOR probe is a product of the GEO-SYNC satellite hundreds of miles above firing a THRUSTER in the opposite vector.  Becasue the object suspended from the cable is taut at the end of the cable it will suddenly move away from observer at thousands of miles per hour. It is not MAGIC and it is NOT a new drive. The space END of the ANCHOR is moving 17k MPH and the low atmoshere end of the puppet is moving only a few hundred miles.  The HIGH speed it a factor of The magic of GEO SYNC orbit with a very long string. 

##  OCCAM's RAZOR
Dropping an object down into atmoshere VERY SLOWLY from a GEO SYNC orbit will prevent heating of the cable. The uppoer part of the cable is shielded against friction, the atmoshere is very thin so particles are far apart, where the cable then tappers off, down to just a few fiber CLEAR optic threads down where it is connected to the the SPY PROBE sensor. The sensors weigh only a few dozen pounds and are often mounted on a GIMBLE inside of a clear plastic sphere, that allows device rotation and adaptive camera positioning.
Essientially we have a sensor on the end of a stiff fishing line dropped into the atmosphere. Which explains why the objects shot down have been found to have "STRINGS" attached to them. Additionally the might use plastic shells to prevent the device from being snagged in the wind. Coat the capsule/tic-tac with teflon and or a reflective MYLAR and the object will look metallic.

#### Theory and Applications of Multi-Tethers in Space
Fan Zhang, Panfeng Huang

This book offers a comprehensive overview of recently developed space multi-tethers, such as maneuverable space tethered nets and space tethered formation. For each application, it provides detailed derivatives to describe and analyze the mathematical model of the system, and then discusses the design and proof of different control schemes for various problems. The dynamics modeling presented is based on Newton and Lagrangian mechanics, and the book also introduces Hamilton mechanics and Poincaré surface of section for dynamics analysis, and employs both centralized and distributed controllers to derive the formation question of the multi-tethered system. In addition to the equations and text, it includes 3D design drawings, schematic diagrams, control scheme blocks and tables to make it easy to understand. This book is intended for researchers and graduate students in the fields of astronautics, control science, and engineering.
